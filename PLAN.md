# Plan: Remove Initial Landing Page and Start Quiz Directly

## Overview
The goal is to modify the Spanish quiz application to start directly with the first question instead of showing the introduction page first.

## Current Flow
1. App.tsx → Index.tsx → QuizController (stage: "intro")
2. QuizController renders IntroductionPage component
3. User clicks "Start Now" button
4. QuizController transitions to "questions" stage
5. First question is displayed

## Proposed New Flow
1. App.tsx → Index.tsx → QuizController (stage: "questions")
2. QuizController directly renders the first question
3. User answers questions without seeing the introduction page

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modify QuizController.tsx
- Change initial state from "intro" to "questions"
- Ensure questionHistory is properly initialized with the first question ID
- Remove or modify the handleStartQuiz function since it won't be needed
- Keep the IntroductionPage component but don't render it by default

### 2. Files to Modify
- `src/components/quiz/QuizController.tsx`

### 3. Specific Changes
1. Change line 20: `const [stage, setStage] = useState<QuizStage>("intro");` to `const [stage, setStage] = useState<QuizStage>("questions");`
2. Ensure questionHistory is initialized with the first question ID (already done in lines 21-23)
3. Remove or comment out the "intro" case in the renderStage function (lines 266-273)
4. Keep the IntroductionPage import and component for potential future use

### 4. Testing
- Verify the quiz starts directly with the first question
- Ensure navigation between questions works correctly
- Confirm the progress bar shows correctly
- Test that the quiz still completes properly and shows results

## Benefits
- Faster entry into the quiz content
- Reduced friction for users who want to start immediately
- Cleaner, more direct user experience
